    <h2>Description</h2>
    
    <p>Prawns are a delicious and versatile ingredient that can be enjoyed in a multitude of ways. From curries and salads to Middle Eastern recipes, our best ever prawn collection has it all.</p>
    <p>Prawns are a great midweek meal ingredient as they only take minutes to cook. You can buy them chilled or frozen, raw or ready-cooked. Always defrost frozen prawns thoroughly to ensure safe and even cooking. Most recipes will specify shell-on or peeled but peeled are probably the most widely sold and convenient.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li>150g cooked peeled king prawns</li>
        <li>¼ cucumber, diced</li>
        <li>2 spring onions, chopped</li>
        <li>50g edamame beans, defrosted if frozen</li>
        <li>6 radishes, chopped</li>
        <li>½ avocado, diced</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
   
    <ol>
        <li>Frying prawns: To fry simply heat oil in a pan until smoking hot. Add peeled prawns and cook until pink (if using pre-cooked a couple of minutes will be enough to heat through).</li>
        <li>Boiling prawns: If you prefer to boil raw peeled prawns (before adding to a prawn cocktail for example) drop into boiling water with salt and juice of a lemon and cook for 3-4 minutes until pink then drain well.</li>
        <li>Grilling prawns: Large raw shell-on prawns can be grilled either on a griddle, under a hot grill or on the BBQ in the summer. Just toss in oil and seasoning then cook for about 3 minutes per side until they turn from silvery grey to bright pink. You can tell prawns are cooked when they turn pink, curl up and feel firm when squeezed.</li>
    </ol>
