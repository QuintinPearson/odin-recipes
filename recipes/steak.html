    <h2>Description</h2>
    
    <p>This is Steak, to be brutaly honest, it really is that special. It's just so tasty, we just continue eating it and making it out of habit because it's just so delicious.</p>
    <p>On the other hand people could state that they would not eat that for the rest of their lives and I know nothing.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter, softened, divided</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon minced fresh parsley</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon minced garlic</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon reduced-sodium soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 beef flat iron steak or boneless top sirloin steak (3/4 pound)</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon pepper</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
   
    <ol>
        <li>1. Mix 1 tablespoon butter with parsley, garlic and soy sauce.</li>
        <li>2. Sprinkle steak with salt and pepper. In a large skillet, heat remaining butter over medium heat. Add steak; cook until meat reaches desired doneness (for medium-rare, a thermometer should read 135°; medium, 140°; medium-well, 145°), 4-7 minutes per side. Serve with garlic butter.</li>
    </ol>
